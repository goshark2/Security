Recently, I completed the Compromised Windows Analysis room on TryHackMe, and it was an incredibly insightful dive into Windows Forensics and Incident Response. 
Here I’ll walk through the key investigation steps, forensic tools, and the attacker’s full timeline I uncovered during the challenge.

TKM, a small tech startup, detected suspicious SSH traffic to a known malicious IP from one of its employee's machines (Aashir’s host). The junior security engineer, Joe, noticed:

**SSH connection attempts every minute**

Windows Defender was disabled

The user was unaware of any such activity

A recurring prompt showed up every minute

Joe quickly blocked the IP, contained the host, and escalated for a deeper investigation. That’s where we step in as forensic investigators.
